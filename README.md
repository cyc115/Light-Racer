##Game status up to now(09/11/13)
<pre>
1.The Game is now playable (sorta).
2.Everything is pushed under HanGameCore
3.GameFrame and GamePanel can host a game.GamePanel can load Map from Map Class. Keylisteners have been implemented 
and works with both players( WASD for player 1 and the arrows for player 2)
4.There is currently no collison dectetion. This needs to be implemented before the demo.
6.I've added a background image to the game (looks way cooler). However you need downlaod the image (tron2.jpg) from the Drive 
and you need to specify the path in the GamePanel constructor. 
7.There is a demo image on the drive.

8.Game may lag on your computer.The ups and fps are printed on the console. Ups should remain stable at around 30.
Fps may change depeding on your computer's hardware.If you don't want to display the background, comment out 
g.drawImage(bkgimg, 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(),null); in GamePanel
